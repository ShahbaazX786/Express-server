# Express Server
A server i created as a repo to just import the code and modify in projects to speed up process.
<br>
--Even though writing code from scratch improves your knowledge as it is just like practising the code again and again.
<br>
-- but I think the routes will be different for different project requirements so just create a basic quicksave like repo wil be quite handy. 

<br>
<br>
to run server just exec command "Nodemon app.js" or "Nodemon start" in terminal.
